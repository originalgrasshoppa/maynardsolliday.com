===== Stuck Service =====

If you ever have trouble with a service being stuck in a 'starting' or 'stopping' state, you can run a couple of simple commands to kill the service.

== Query the process ==
To kill the service you have to know its PID or Process ID. To find this just type the following in at a command prompt:

<code>sc queryex <servicename></code>

Replace 'servicename' with the services registry name. For example: Print Spooler is spooler.


== Identify the PID ==
After running the query you will by presented with a list of details. You will want to locate the PID.

== Run the Taskkill command ==

Now that you have the PID, you can run the following command to kill the hung process:

<code>taskkill /f /pid [PID]</code>

This will force kill the hung service.
