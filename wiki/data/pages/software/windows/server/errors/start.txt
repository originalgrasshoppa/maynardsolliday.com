===== Fix WMI Event ID 10 =====
<code>
Event filter with query "SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent WITHIN 60 WHERE TargetInstance ISA "Win32_Processor" AND TargetInstance.LoadPercentage > 99" could not be reactivated in namespace "//./root/CIMV2" because of error 0x80041003. Events cannot be delivered through this filter until the problem is corrected.
</code>

Boot into safe mode. First, open services and stop the Windows Management Instrumentation Service.
<code>
net stop "Windows Management Instrumentation"
</code>
Take ownership of the folder or the contents of the folder "C:\Windows\System32\wbem\Repository." I've done this three times now on different installs and didn't have any issues after doing this, but I suggest you back up the folder to be certain. Delete the contents of the folder. Reboot. When you boot into Vista, you might notice a half dozen or so application errors...it's OK.
Reboot again, and Event ID 10 will be gone, along with the afore mentioned application errors.

After doing this, MS DTC Service may stop running; you will get this event, even after subsequent reboots:

<code>
Event 4691: The run-time environment was unable to initialize for transactions required to support transactional components. Make sure that MS-DTC is running. (DtcGetTransactionManagerEx(): hr = 0x8004d027)
</code>
and
<code>
Event 4427: Failed to initialize the needed name objects. Error Specifics: hr = 0x80004005, d:\rtm\com\complus\dtc\dtc\msdtcprx\src\dtcinit.cpp:571, CmdLine: C:\Windows\system32\dllhost.exe /Processid:{02D4B3F1-FD88-11D1-960D-00805FC79235}, Pid: 3060
</code>

This is the way you get rid of these:

At a command prompt, type the following command: 
<code>
%WINDIR%\System32\msdtc.exe -uninstall
</code>
Start Registry Editor, and then remove the following registry keys if they exist:
  - HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CID
  - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSDTC 
  - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\MSDTC 
  - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet002\Services\MSDTC 
  - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\MSDTC 

At a command prompt, type:
<code>
%WINDIR%\System32\msdtc.exe -install
</code>
