<p>
If you ever have trouble with a service being stuck in a &#039;starting&#039; or &#039;stopping&#039; state, you can run a couple of simple commands to kill the service.
</p>

</div>

<h5 id="query_the_process">Query the process</h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
To kill the service you have to know its PID or Process ID. To find this just type the following in at a command prompt:
</p>
<pre class="code">sc queryex &lt;servicename&gt;</pre>

<p>
Replace &#039;servicename&#039; with the services registry name. For example: Print Spooler is spooler.
</p>

</div>

<h5 id="identify_the_pid">Identify the PID</h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
After running the query you will by presented with a list of details. You will want to locate the PID.
</p>

</div>

<h5 id="run_the_taskkill_command">Run the Taskkill command</h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
Now that you have the PID, you can run the following command to kill the hung process:
</p>
<pre class="code">taskkill /f /pid [PID]</pre>

<p>
This will force kill the hung service.
</p>
