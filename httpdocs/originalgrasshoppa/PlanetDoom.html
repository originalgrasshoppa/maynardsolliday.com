<span style="font-weight: bold; ">Now that you have decided to destroy  the

planet you head towards the next door. Yeah the one marked "Warning Level 

 20 clearance needed". As you close in on the door you realize there is a 

low humming sound. You go through the door and the humming stops. The room 

is black and hard to see in. you continue walking and begin charging your 

beam cannon so you can use it's light to see.<img alt="zzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZZZZT!" src="samuschargingblast.jpg" style="width: 202px; height: 151px; " align="Top">

<br />

    One word describes what you find in the depths of the black room, %^$#(sorry 

 the school sensors this stuff).<br />

    Metroid breeding tanks and they're EVERYWHERE!!!!The metroids I mean, 

the  tanks are all busted. You attempt to blast at them and realize it's a

lost  cause. As you try to hold them back with your missles so you can back

out  of the room you realize the door is LOCKED!!! You hear the warbled voices

 of space pirates laughing on the other side of the door. The rest of your

 life is in your imagination.<br />
