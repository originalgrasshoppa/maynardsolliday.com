  <title>I must politely ask this simple little question, are you

INSANE!?!?</title>

<span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Do to your lack of intelligence

and common sense you sprint into the room and begin blasting at the

metroids.<br />

As you seem very willing to die the metroids attempt to oblige you.

They dive at you from all directions and you perform a screw attack and

all that come into contact with you are diced into mushy gelatinous

pieces of ooze. You begin to think the endless seeming metroid stream

may actually BE endless. Your missles are running low and your energy

is beginning to become a problem.<br />

As your impending doom draws nigh you remember something, YOU ARE

SAMUS, a FREAKING GOD!!! NO metroid can KILL YOU!!! With this

revelation you gather your power for one last assualt.<img

You lanch your charge blast at the metroids<img alt="BAM!!!!"

<br />

Two go down with a shriek of terror and pain. Gathering your missles <img

 style="width: 144px; height: 160px;" align="top"> <br />

You launch a supermissle into the pod of metroids and watch in glee as

the group explodes into pieces of jelly.<br />

<br />

Congrats the metroids are defeated. But now you have a decision to

make. Obviously the space pirates have&nbsp; been mass producing

metroids and

you must stop them, however, you must also protect the galaxy from

another

metroid excursion. You must either <a href="PlanetDoom.html">destroy

the

planet of Zebes</a> or <a href="ThePathofViolence.html">hunt down and

destroy every space pirate

and then every metroid except the metroid that the Galactic Federation

wants

of course </a> , or you can <a href="GuerrillaWarfare.html">try to

capture the metroid and then retreat to your ship and let the

Federation deal with the metroids and space pirates.</a> <br />
