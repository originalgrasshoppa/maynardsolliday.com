<h1>Hope</h1>

<p>

I feel so childish again, crushing and being shy.  It's all so odd, to feel so for the first time in years.  I don't know how compatible we are for sure, but I do know I enjoy being with her and we get along so well it's as if we have been friends for years.  Tell me a year ago, even a month ago, that I would meet someone like this online, and that I'd actually hang out with them and crush on them, I would have laughed at you and said "Ridiculous."

<br />

I can't find a reason not to go for this, a relationship with someone that has so many qualities that I like, someone who is so much like the kind of person I always thought I would never find.

I can't say that I don't want to rush in, but I know we gotta take it kinda slow, jumping into this too hard could make it difficult.  I think it is gonna be difficult to not go too fast, especially since we have only hung out 2 times in the last 5 days, the first was for 8 hours, the second ended with me staying the night at her house, spending 20 hours straight with her.

and yet, we have not had a dull moment yet.  I just feel so at ease and light when I am with her, maybe it's just a fleeting deal and it'll be gone in a week or two, but I hope this feeling never fades, it is wonderful.

I can't wait to see her again.
