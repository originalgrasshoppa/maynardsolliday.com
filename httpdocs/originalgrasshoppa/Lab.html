<b><font color="#ff6600">You go back through the door and see the

creature has dissappeared. No matter you must continue to find the

metroid. You sprint across the room and through the next door. What you

find here is almost

worse than the creature in the last room. Ridley is in a stasis capsule.<img

Step carefully you do NOT want to <a href="AcrankyRidley.html">free

him</a> . Definitely not here. You cross the room and see there is

something in

a capsule. You can <a href="HeisfreakingHUGE.html">reach for it</a> ,

however there is a tiny lizard-like creature in there. It is in a

stasis but opening the capsule would change that VERY quickly. Studying

the creature you realize it looks sorta.....familiar.......no it can't

be. Let's <a href="DarkRoom.html"> move on</a> . You have choices to

make so go ahead. Choose your path Bounty Bounty Hunter.</font></b><br />
