          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have beaten a game that took   about   

20  hours    to  complete.  This includes working on the weekend(what   free

   time?!).  Before    school, during  other classes, and every free   spare

 second  we had.  This  is  the second webquest  I've done. Since this  is

a joint effort, so  my friend    Mick needs a LOT of  credit. Do you know

 how much HTML he went   &nbsp;through?!?(%20....NOOOOO!!!)<br />

  <br />

                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this is only the first

part   of  the   quest,    I  would   suggest visiting the other quest. It

helps   complete   what story    is  here.<br />

                        Also, I didn't draw anything on this site(stick figures 

   are   out   of  my  leauge)so  thanks to everyone who put their pictures 

  on the   web so  I could  use them.<br />

  <br />

                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now.....how did you like my quest?<br />
