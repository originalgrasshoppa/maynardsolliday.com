<font color="#33cc00"><b>You went through the door. Good choice. What

moron would bomb a floor for no reason anyways? You look around and

realize you're on a space pirate ship. Yeah the one you were on before

going to Tallon

IV. Now this wouldn't be so wierd if it wasn't for the fact that

you....uhhh.....BLEW IT UP!!!! This is the power core room. The very

one you sent Voltar down and

selfdestructed the ship. *SSSTHIT GGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAA*<br />

Oh no. Voltar is still alive. Well after this encounter she won't be.

You begin wailing on Voltar and her health steadily drops. You kill her

and watch as she falls once again into the core. you prepare to run

when the sirens start but after several minutes they don't go off. Then

you realize what's been going on. Space pirates have been geneticaly

modifying all these creatures. Voltar is a clone. The environments were

created so as to create nearly perfect replicas. &nbsp;Why would space

pirates want to clone these creatures? The only thing they have in

common is you. They must be trying to find a creature skiled enough to

defeat you. Riiiiigggghhhttt.....they wish. You continue on through the

next <a href="EnterDarkSamus.html">door</a> .<br />
