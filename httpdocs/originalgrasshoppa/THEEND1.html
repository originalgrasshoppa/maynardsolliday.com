   You scream as you lanch your final attack on the Omega Metroid. You charge 

 your beam and fire at the chest of the massive metroid. A scream unlike anything

 you have ever heard before fills the room. The Omega Metroid falls backword,

 a hole in it's chest. A massive wave of phazon washes over everything. You

 stand, looking at the battlefield,thinking. Finally you walk out to find

the space pirates plan and stop it for good.<br />
