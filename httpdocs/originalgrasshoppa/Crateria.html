<font color="#006600"><b><span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Since you

ignored me you have now reached the hostile area of Crateria. You find

the soldiers that were sent ahead of you to recapture the metroid. I

would

tell you what they look like but I think you might find it- well let's

just

say only their mothers could still love them.<br />

<br />

<br />

Moving on you find that the place has many dead space pirates lying

about many more than would be accountable for the Galactic Federation

Soldiers' fight. Some space pirates seem to be devoid of bodily fluids.

They seem

almost mummified. I think I want to leave now. What kills space

pirates?

They are the intergalactic scum of the universe and are quite resilient

as a side effect. The only things that space pirates could never seem

to

destroy are you.....and.......<small><small> metroids<big><big>.....<br />

Yeah, this is kinda, sorta, extremely bad. I'm gonna go now so you have

fun di-I mean fighting off the metroids.<br />

<br />

<br />

Are you going to go in <a href="BlastingatMetroids.html">super missles

blazing</a> or are you going to follow me and <a href="RUN.html">run

away screaming at the top of your lungs whilst praying to God that you

might have a slight chance of staying alive even if they tear off your

legs.</a> <br />
