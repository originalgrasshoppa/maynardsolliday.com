<font color="#cc0000">Since you are either an idiot or have a surpise

up your sleeve, you have chosen to awaken the devilish dog Ridley. Now

that you

woke Ridley he looks around as if he is confused, then he looks right

at

you and- he is beginning to GROW!!! He quickly fills the stasis

chamber. You

shield yourelf from the explosion of glass as Ridley breaks free. He

then

grows some more and once he has stopped he spreads his wings and flexes

them

whilst watching you. <img src="ridley.jpg" alt="Ridley Stretching"

<b><font color="#000099"> It seems that Ridley remembers you quite

well.

He charges you, and you dodge. You start blasting him but he doesn't

seem

to notice that you are even attempting to hurt him. You keep shooting

but

he doesn't even slow down. You begin charging a super missle but he

grabs

you.<img src="samusandridleyheadtomissle.jpg"

 alt="You are SO totaly SCREWED!!!" align="top" height="224" width="280">

<br />

You are ready to fire even though you have finally admited that maybe

waking

Ridley WAS a bad idea.<br />
