<p>

Raging thoughts crash against my mind, destroying rationality and destroying my logic.  My life is crumbling because I can not function when I feel this way; the alcohol comes in after this lack of ability comes.  

</p>

<p>

I feel as if the thing I have always waited for has come and I am letting it go again.  I felt no sadness, no depression, no irritating moments, nothing could ruin my day, every moment I was with her was as if my life was moving the way it was always meant to be.  I leave her behind by creating her chance to flee back into the world outside my grasp.  Floating out of reach I stare at her back feeling as if I have no oxygen.  I’m about on the edge of my sanity.  I fear the loss of her will push my limits of recovery.  Maybe the choice was a necessity, but for now it feels as if I pushed her into the boundary of my world and asked if she wanted someone trapped in the bubble of routine, bound to a future of predictability and possible prosperity, or if she wanted a world that has limitless prosperity, a world where anyone can be anything, people can change and manipulate themselves, events, and each other. Upon this choice, she went for the unknown, the chance of more than the life that could be foreseen within my glass world.  

</p>

<p>

I failed to keep the one who may have made my life perfect within the boundaries of my world.  I will maybe find another, one who is satisfied with a life that has no unseen curves, no blind turns. 

</p>

<p>

She believed herself to be less than good, felt herself to be inadequate, and then I shoved a fact into sight that made her feel that all her ridiculous views of herself were true.  Her fear of being overweight,   yet she was beautiful to me.  I gave not just a piece of my life to her, but already a piece of my heart.  I fail to understand why I fall so quickly for the ones who do not wish to fall in return.  They know what they will get from me, and fear the life of known possibilities and yearn for a life of unparalleled potential.  My thoughts will forever lead me astray; the one time my logic worked how and where I wanted it too, it failed miserably.  My own inadequacies stare me in the face.  I feel when I shouldn’t, I feel what I shouldn’t, for those who deserve so much better than they let themselves have.  They deserve happiness; they deserve to have their bad memories reduced to faded shadows of a shadow.  They deserve to be treated with love and care, to be treated as the great and beautiful people they are.  Not because they are physically beautiful, but because they are mentally beautiful, like a bright, sunny, spring day in a meadow. 

</p>

<p>

I am forever alone because I want to make people better, I want them to succeed in their goals, I want them to be happy and have everything they want.  No one wants a person around with the ability to bring their happiness from their face into their soul. No one wants themselves to be truly happy, because then the question arises: what do I live for?

</p>

<p>

I will never be perfect, I will never have horrible faults, I will never follow all the rules, I will never be a rebel, I will never be a do-gooder, I will never be a criminal, I will never be rich, I will never be poor, I will never be able to kill myself, I will never be able to live my life, I will never be alone, I will forever be uncompleted.

</p>

<p>

Alone in a world where everyone wants me around but nobody wants me.  I will always be the ground that people use to climb back up from, the tree that is used to pull up from the grass, the net that is used to protect everyone from sinking to the lowest possible places in their lives.

</p>

<p>

I am cursed to be forever left behind with the fond memories of times past, and hope of a great future, but no perfect present.

</p>

<p>

My life is an endless circle of being found, tested, then left for being something too promising, too bold, too solid. I will always be the unhated.
