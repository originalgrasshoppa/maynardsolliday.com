to fire. You watch as Prime realizes what you are doing and try's to

reach you before you can fire. You jump up and perform a backflip. As

soon as you are head up you fire. Dark Samus stands back up and heads

towards you. Just when you thought you might have to blast her again

You grab the metroid and a siren begins to sound "Warning! Phazon

Presence in Metroid A Holding cell! Planetary selfdestruct

initiated!&nbsp;Warning! Phazon Presence in Metroid A Holding cell!

Planetary selfdestruct initiated!" <br />
