No! it's Prime!! You glance behind her and see the baby metroid. So it

seems killing this thing will be an objective for your mission. Good

saves

the trouble of having to hunt it down. You charge your new beam and

start

firing. the copy returns fire and you both seem equally matched. AS the

hope of either one of you winning fades, you realize there is an easier

way to do this. you jump sideways and start blasting super missiles.</b></font>

<font color="#000000"><b> The Dark Samus continues to take it

while

still coming towards you. You finally can't take it any more so you

drop

to morph ball form and start dropping powerbombs. The Dark Samus walks

through

them and begins to smoke and shed her skin. she is practically

transparent

now. Should you fire at her with a <a href="Holycrap.html">Sonic Boom</a>

(Super missiles combined with Annialator Beam.) or will you <a
