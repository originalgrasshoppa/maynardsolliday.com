<font color="#990000"><big>As you go through the door you get the

feeling that you are being watched again. This time there is no

explanation beyond the fact that there IS someone watching you. You

quickly look around and

realize that there is another you on the other side of the room. How is

this

possible? It's you but you know that it is not. This version of you is

wearing

a black suit. Thinking back you reflect on all your previous excursions

and

try to brain storm who would create something like this or how. Space

Pirates?

No they can't create something like this. This is too advanced even for

them. The thing stands and aims at you. You watch in amazed horror as

it CHARGES A BEAM CANNON BLAST!!! You launch yourself through the

nearest door and

escape the creature for now.<br />

<br />

As you observe your surroundings you scan a computer that holds some

intruiging information. You find logs about this creature you have just

met. It is

called "Dark Samus" The space pirates found it on Tallon IV! It seems

to

be an exact copy of yourself except that it is enhanced by phazon

mutation.

..........OH NO!!!! There is a chart and it shows how this creature has

come to be.<br />
