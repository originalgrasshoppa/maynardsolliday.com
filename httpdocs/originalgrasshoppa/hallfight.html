 You run into the hall, firing. You drop a couple of them before you get

hit. You duck into a door to wait for a chance to return fire. hey...the

door is unlocked!! <a href="super2.html">Will you go in?</a>

  Or will you fight with what you got. No forget that, go in the door!!!

You'll be killed!!!
