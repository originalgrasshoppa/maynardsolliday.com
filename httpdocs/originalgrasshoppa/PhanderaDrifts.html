  <font color="#ffff00">You have bombed the floor and dropped down to-Phandera

 Drifts!? But Phandera is on Tallon IV which wouldn't bother you but, you're

 on <big><big><u><i><b>ZEBES</b></i></u></big></big>!!!!<br />

  It looks like the golem hasn't gotten over the fact that you kicked his 

can and it looks like he wants a rematch. Obviously you'll oblige as you have

no idea how to LEAVE!!!! As you prepare your missiles and thermal visor,

 you realize something is different. The golem seems, well, hesitant. Then

 you notice why, There are some other contenders in the ring.<img src="mp2_ingsmasher_1.jpg" alt="Ing Smasher" width="320" height="224">

  Now it's understandable. This golem is being restrained?- by the corrupted

 Ing Smashers. You decide it would be best to try and take down the golem

before  messing with the Ing Smashers. So you charge some missiles and lock

on to the golem. Steady, aim it perfectly-"squee". What the-oh no! You turn

around and see a cluster of space pirates have just released a pod of metroids

in to the coliseum. The golem goes crazy. He charges the metroids. The Ing

Smashers  are crushed whilst trying to stop the golem. You realize you're

next if you  don't move. You strafe left and make it out of the way. The

space pirates  notice you and run out of the coliseum. The golem is obliterating

the metroids.  As it beats the metroids to pulp he smashes one into the wall.

You watch in  amazement as the metroids are destroyed. Then you hear a sharp

*CRACK!* You  look up and realize the golem's poundings are destroying the

coliseum!! A gigantic ice stalactite falls and you dodge only to realize

that another creature has entered through the wall. It's-it's....IT'S A FATHER

SHEEGOTH!!!!!<img src="fathersheegoth.jpg" alt="Sheegoth" width="200" height="200" align="Top">

  <font color="#ffff00">You know this bad right? I would advise a healthy 

run for your LIFE! as you do so, the sheegoth chases after you. It then launches

 some of it's freezing breath and you become a giant ice sickle. HURRY AND

 PRESS B!!!!!!! Before you can the sheegoth reaches you and head butts you

towards  the golem. It has pretty much cleaned up the metroids and it realizes

you  are defenseless. Now it decides is the best time for revenge. He lifts

his  leg.....<br />
