<b><font color="#cc33cc">You turn to find a toothbrush so you can brush

your teeth. After seeing so many cavaties you're deathly afraid of

losing

your teeth. That's when you notice the item that is in the capsule. You

reach for it-Your suit absorbed it!! A status message flashes across

your visor "Annialator Beam acquired."

*RRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH* Sounds

like Kraid is done waiting. You turn your new toy at him and start

unloading.

Kraid is in such agony he cannot even fire a return shot. Finally,

after

taking enough punishment to suit him,</font></b><b><font color="#cc33cc">

he retreats into the depths of his lair</font></b><b><font

 color="#cc33cc">

. You kinda like this new weapon and decide to keep it.<br />

<br />

Now it's time to move on. The next <a href="ReturnofDarkSamus.html">door</a>

is labeled "Metroid A" which looks VERY promising.<br />
