  As you fire missile after missile, you realize that it's armor is too thick

 to be penetrated by even missiles!!! You try to dodge its attack but get

slammed by the red ball!!! Your armor melts like butter!!!! And.........

this is where it gets messy. When it finally finishes beating your body to

a pulp, not even a puppy could love your mangled corpse. <br />
