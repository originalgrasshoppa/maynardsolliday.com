<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet quickly grew and 

encompassed any country in the world with a phone line or cable that linked to 

another computer of another country. Where computers and phones went, the 

internet went.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the internet started out slow. 

The first message ever sent on the internet was "lo" in 1969. The original word 

that was planned to be sent at a, then, wopping 50 kb/s was "login", but as the 

sent it the computer crashed allowing only "lo" through.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within three months The University of Utah and University 

of California Santa Barbara both had their own ARPANET nodes making a total of 

four in the world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the end of 1970 there had been an 

addition of six nodes and nineteen host computers (a computer that provides end 

users with services such as database access).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1971 Ray Tomlinson created the first email program. It 

was called CPYNET. In order to extend the range of people who could use the 

program to any one in the network he created the "commercial at" symbol to 

combine the user and host names. We still use the symbol today in our emails <A 

href="mailto:(australianchicken@thedinnertable.com">(australianchicken<B><FONT 

size=4>@</FONT></B>thedinnertable.com</A>).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then in 1973 the ARPANET makes an enormous leap, Hawaii 

joins the ARPANET via it's satellite link. This allowed computers to connect 

with out a cable by sending electrical impulses through the air.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1974 access to the ARPANET was given to commercial 

companies with a program created by Bolt - Beranek &amp; Newman (BBN). This 

program was called Telnet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1977 the ARPANET has a boom as it hits 111 hosts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1980 the ARPANET was downed by a virus.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1982 the ARPANET was back and kicking. As a result 

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) established a 

system by which different networks can communicate. These linked networks come 

to be known as the internet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1984 the internet reaches an astounding 1,000 hosts 

world wide.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1985 Canada had a network of connections for their 

universities called the the NetNorth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During 1988 Canada joins NSFNET, an international backbone 

of computing centres that enables more network connections.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And just when you thought this had nothing to do with the 

internet today, BAM~~the World Wide Web (WWW) is created by Tim Berners-Lee of 

the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and there are 100,000 

internet hosts worldwide.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all the excitement of 1990 ARPANET ceased it's 

functions and gave way to the internet. Tim Berners-Lee then authored the first 

browser-editor, called WorldWideWeb. He also authored the communication language 

of the internet - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as well as the standard by 

which web pages were to be written, known as Hypertext Markup Language 

(HTML).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1992 a revolution was started as the first video and 

audio were sent across the internet which had hit one million hosts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1993 this was reported to be as much fact as the air we 

breathe is not pure oxygen. There are 15 million people online worldwide and the 

CBC's Bill Cameron reported, "The internet is growing like an embryonic brain at 

a rate of 10 per cent a month."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late 1994 Netscape launched the first available beta 

version of the predominate commercial web browser. this new browser was called 

Mozilla 0.96b.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In&nbsp; 1995 the internet completed it's world wide 

infection with Sun Microsystems introduction of Java programming language, 

RealAudio's introduction, which allowed users to listen to audio over the 

internet in near-real time. Then CBC goes online with its website, and to cap it 

all off the Vatican goes online with its home page.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September of 1998 the user's dreams and prayers were 

answered with the creation of the first uncensored, unfiltered, and efficient 

search engine, Google.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2002 it was announced that there are more than two 

million internet hosts and 840 million users worldwide</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to <A 

href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/">http://www.internetworldstats.com/</A> 

the number of people using the internet by the end of 2005 was <FONT face=Arial 

color=#0000cc size=-1><B>1,018,057,389. </B></FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The internet continues to grow rapidly today. More and 

more countries get more and more populated and more people in different parts of 

the world buy a computer with internet access.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

As you can see the internet had a long and winding rise to power. What we take for granted is a complicated network of computers that were created as a sideaffect of an experiment of the government and universities around the world.
