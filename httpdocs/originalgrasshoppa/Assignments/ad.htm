<p align="center"><font size="5">Are you constantly being harassed by coworkers?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">Being hit on by drunks in a bar?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">Do you try to fight back but end up in the 

hospital?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5">Well here's the answer to your problems!</font></p>

<p align="left">Get yourself a DBZ Bodyguard.</p>

<p align="left"><img border="0" src="brolly.jpg" width="103" height="311" /></p>

<p>This fellow has quite a few amazing abilities. He can take care of those 

annoyances at the office, at school, or even at the local bar.</p>

<p>If someone is harassing you and won't stop, call Brolly into it and your 

problems will be over.</p>

<p>You see the way he works is he begins by using actual fighting stances. As he 

gets angrier he reaches a new form. Yes, that's right, he transforms!</p>

<p>

<img border="0" src="brollyinpurgatorystage.jpg" width="225" height="295" /></p>

<p>In this stage his speed and power increases drastically.</p>

<p>And if he gets angrier... That is 100% correct! He transforms again!</p>

<p>

<img border="0" src="Brollytransformingtolegendary.jpg" width="157" height="146" /></p>

<p>He becomes Legendary Brolly.</p>

<p>

<img border="0" src="brollycloseuplegendary.jpg" width="225" height="178" /></p>

<p>In this form his strength goes through the roof. His speed stays the same but 

due to how much strength he has, he has little need to do much running or 

dodging.</p>

<p>Here is a comparison to his weaker form.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="brollylegendary.jpg" width="459" height="530" /></p>

<p>Quite a difference, yes? Now as he has so much strength he tends to get cocky 

and uses a more lax fighting style. It consists of closelines picking people up 

by their face and slamming them through buildings.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="brollyfacegrab.jpg" width="100" height="92" /></p>

<p>Brolly comes equipped with a mind control device which allows you to control 

him nearly all the time. The only exception is in the presence of a man named 

Kakarot. In case of Kakarot exposure, please run far far away.</p>

<p>Warning: In presence of Kakarot, Brolly may crunch you up in a personalized 

space shuttle and throw you into a meteor that is going to destroy a planet.<br />

Brolly has a tendency to grow angry over small annoyances such as traffic jams, 

airport delays, and being told not to kill somebody.<br />

Do not submerse mind control device in water. Do not, under any circumstances 

take off the mind control device. Do not tease Brolly with the word Kakarot and 

or pictures like this:

<img border="0" src="kidgoku.jpg" width="111" height="164" /> kid Kakarot (A.K.A. 

Goku), <img border="0" src="gokussj.gif" width="94" height="169" /> adult Goku,&nbsp;

and <img border="0" src="goten.jpg" width="123" height="156" />Gotssssssssssssssssen. These 

picture represent everything Brolly hates and will cause extreme anger and 

hatred.</p>
