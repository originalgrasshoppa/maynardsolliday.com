<p align="center"><u><font size="5"><b>Home</b></font></u></p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">I finally get home and do a few chores. 

Turn on the heater, clean </font>some stuff, the usuall<font color="#FFFFFF"> 

junk. Then I grab a snack and sit down to do what I love third most in life. 

Video games. Medal of Honor, Call of Duty, Twisted Metal, </font>Metroid Prim<font color="#FFFFFF">e, 

Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros., Metal Gear, Syphon Filter, If it's a game 

odds are I've either heard of it or played it. NE</font>S, PS2, PS<font color="#FFFFFF">, 

Gamecube, Super NES, X Box, PC games, I've even played Atari. It is awsome. Old 

school PONG, Centipede, and all the other goodies.</font></b></p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Aside from the games I also have to 

work aro</font>und the house as we own three bu<font color="#FFFFFF">sinesses. 

Yeah but we don't make it rich so don't be t</font>hinking &quot;I'm<font color="#FFFFFF"> 

gonna rob the rich boy.&quot; we make enough but</font> we are by no means rich. This 

pic<font color="#FFFFFF">ture in the background is not my house. My house is

</font>bigger and is in<font color="#FFFFFF"> the proccess of being remodeled by 

me and m</font>y family.</b></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>I do all this then I go to sleep round 

midnight. So that's a summary of an average day for me.</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Before you go back to my home page here are some 

<a href="adayinthelifeof...8.5.htm">pictures</a> to give you a rough idea on what exactly I am talking about.</b></font></p>
