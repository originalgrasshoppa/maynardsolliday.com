<font color="#3333CC">I face the mornings with tranquility and a calm that 
should be revered as the ultimatum of composure as i have to deal with English 
for 3rd hour. But let us move back to 1st and 2nd hour which are Weightlifting 
and Lifetime Fitness. Weights is a class in which, you guessed it, you lift 
weights. Making my morning a sweet colorful whirlpool of variety I have Life Fit 
2nd hour and in that class we play games such as dodge ball, and my personal 
favorite, badminton. After these classes English begins and my composure leaps 
for freedom and makes it by about 15 feet because that's how far the door is 
from my desk. I fail to keep my opinionated side to myself, so my teacher has 
little patience with me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people find this to be in bad 
taste but I find it to be my inner hope and desire: Mark Twain deserves to be 
dug up, light afire, basted in caramel, have peanuts dribbled over his steaming 
caramel exterior then have squirrels that have not eaten in 3 weeks be set upon 
his skeletal carcass. In all truthfulness I have a bad mind for many of the 
classic &quot;novel&quot; writers. John Steinbeck is only slightly exempt from my 
criticism because I enjoyed <u>Of Mice and Men</u>. I DID NOT however, enjoy <u>
Grapes of Wrath</u>. This book is WIDELY overrated. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let's move on to a class that 
puts me in a <a href="adayinthelifeof...3.htm">good mood</a>.</font></b></p>
