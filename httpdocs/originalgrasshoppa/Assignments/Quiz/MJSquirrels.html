MJ Squirrels are of such a pure evil that even their fellow squirrels

are terrified of them. Due to their previous social statis, normaly an

outcast or rising politician, they go to an individual of teaching them

over 1001 ways of "playing" with children. These squirrels are not only

sick and EXTREMELY demented but are so foul that we only recommend them

as a last resort. <br />

<br />

MJ Squirrels are easy to tell apart from your average squirrel as the

wear a white glove similar to this <br />

one&gt;<img alt="White Glove"

 style="width: 114px; height: 163px;" align="top"> on their left front

paw.<br />

<br />

Remember! due to their nature they ARE A LAST RESORT!!<br />

<br />

They cost roughly $5,000 and one young boy between the age of 4 and 18.

(The boy is to be locked in a room with the squirrel at all times the

squirrel is not at work running off the other squirrels. Remember that

the MJ Squirrel does NOT kill the other squirrels. He DOES cause them

to leave for a minimum of 20 years. The boy must be changed once every

2 weeks. We recommend being FULLY clothed while handling the MJ

Squirerel.<br />

If you are sure, sure as in 900,000,000,000% SURE, call 1(800) HLP-MMEE.<br />
