&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Maynard Solliday, but I go by Mick.  I work as a Tec-e for the I.S. Dept. at Butler Community College.
I also work several side jobs, one for my parents, helping maintain our family-owned businesses.
I play video games, mess with computers, and watch anime.  I enjoy reading but do it less than the others.
I believe myself to be laid-back, I enjoy jokes and find humor in many situations.
I am a fairly self confident person, there is not a whole lot that I feel I can't accomplish if I want to.
My mom is Loree, she was the secretary at Flinthills for 7 years, now she works at The Farm Inc. in El Dorado.
My dad is Dave and he has been working at the El Dorado State Park as a GMRT for 6 years.
My brother Jacob, is a Sophomore at Flinthills.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I plan to attend Butler Community College for two years and get my basics and pre-requisites out of the way, then move on to a larger institution to further my education.
I plan to major in electronic engineering and minor in computer software engineering.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to get out and see places I haven't been to yet so I plan to travel some in my future, Japan, California, places like that.
I really don't plan on ending up here in Kansas if I can help it, but nothing is set in stone yet.
I also hope to someday make mucho bucks messing with computers or electronic hardware. That's why I go to college, right?
