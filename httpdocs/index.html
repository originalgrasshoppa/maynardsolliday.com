Welcome to my website.  It has been over four years in the making and I have come a long ways in my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and the many languages and styles of the web.  This page is dedicated to my portfolio as well as my resum&eacute; and the previewing of my work.  Please look around and if you have any questions, contact me by email at mick@maynardsolliday.com.
