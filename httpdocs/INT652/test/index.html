                            <p><em>The exceptional democratic spirit of the game of Bocce is the basis on which its deeply peaceful character is founded. It is often the beginning of lasting friendships.</em></p>
                            <p>To the uninitiated, bocce may look confusing. In reality, it's incredibly simple. And its simplicity makes the game more fun.</p>

                    <div class="image_wrapper image_fl"><img src="images/mo_image_01.jpg" alt="Image 1" /></div>
                            <p>The sport is played with one small ball (Pallino) and eight larger balls, Bocce (singular), Bocci (plural)—four for each team. The Pallino is thrown first and becomes the target. Then each Bocce is thrown with the goal of placing it as close to the Pallino as possible.

                        <p>The rules are fairly simple, but rather than go through explaining them all in my own words, I fgure what better way than by allowing you access to the official rules <a href="http://www.maynardsolliday.com/maynardsolliday/yeah/files/rules.pdf">here</a></p>

                        <p>Typical problems subject to penalties:<br />
Failure to properly call the throw and receive acknowledgment by the Referee;<br />
Foot fault—throw must take place behind a designated line;<br />
Illegal throw—see requirements of a Punto, Raffa and Volo as defined in the rules;<br />
Delay of game—taking longer than 30 seconds to throw;<br />
Intentional grounding—Bocce not thrown in a manner that advances the team's position;<br />
Disorderly conduct.</p>

                               <p><em>A Brief History</em></p>
                      <p>The early Romans were among the first to play a game resembling what we know as bocce today. In early times they used coconuts brought back from Africa and later used hard olive wood to carve out bocce balls.<br />Beginning with Emperor Augustus, bocce became the sport of statesman and rulers. From the early Greek physician Ipocrates to the great Italian Renaissance man Galileo, the early participants of bocce have noted that the game’s athleticism and spirit of competition rejuvenates the body.</p>

                        <h2>In America</h2>
                            <p>The sport first came to America in the English version called bowis from the French boule meaning ball. In accord with how the game was played in Britain, American players threw the ball not on stone dust (as is done today in bocce) but on close cropped grass which some say is the origin of the modern lawn. <br />It has been noted that one early American playing field was Bowling Green at the southern tip of Manhattan and that George Washington built a court at Mount Vernon in the 1780s.</p>
