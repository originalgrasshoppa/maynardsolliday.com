    <h1>About True Walkthroughs</h1>
    <p>True Walkthroughs had humble beginings.  An individual with a dream to share knowledge, share knowledge as quickly and easily as possible.  In order to accomplish this goal, he decided the best way would be an enormous database that can have knowledge poured into it and others can access on a whim.  The internet is the perfect place to store such a large amount of information and it is easily accessible by millions of people all over the world.  What seperates this dream from other sites filled with information?  The goal here is to explain principles and concepts in such a way that without previous or further knowledge of the topic an individual could still learn and use the information with a moderate level of understanding.</p>
    <p>So he created True Walkthroughs, a site where we are all about understanding and furthering our knowledge.</p>
