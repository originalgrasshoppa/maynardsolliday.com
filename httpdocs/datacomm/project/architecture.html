    <h1 class="h1">Architecture</h1>
    <p class="indent">The SSH-2 protocol has an internal  architecture (defined in RFC 4251) with well-separated layers.  These are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The transport layer (RFC 4253). This layer handles initial key exchange and server  	authentication and sets up encryption, compression and integrity  	verification. It exposes to the upper layer an interface for sending  	and receiving plaintext packets of up to 32,768 bytes each (more can  	be allowed by the implementation). The transport layer also arranges  	for key re-exchange, usually after 1 GB of data has been transferred  	or after 1 hour has passed, whichever is sooner.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The user authentication layer  	(RFC 4252). This layer handles client authentication and provides a  	number of authentication methods. Authentication is client-driven:  	when one is prompted for a password, it may be the SSH client  	prompting, not the server. The server merely responds to client's  	authentication requests. Widely used user authentication methods  	include the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>password: a method for  		straightforward password authentication, including a facility  		allowing a password to be changed. This method is not implemented  		by all programs.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>publickey: a method for public  		key-based authentication, usually supporting at  		least DSA or RSA keypairs, with other  		implementations also supporting X.509 certificates.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>keyboard-interactive (RFC  		4256): a versatile method where the server sends one or more  		prompts to enter information and the client displays them and sends  		back responses keyed-in by the user. Used to provide one-time  		password authentication such as S/Key or SecurID.  		Used by some OpenSSH configurations when PAM is the  		underlying host authentication provider to effectively provide  		password authentication, sometimes leading to inability to log in  		with a client that supports just the plain password authentication  		method.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>GSSAPI authentication  		methods which provide an extensible scheme to perform SSH  		authentication using external mechanisms such as Kerberos  		5 or NTLM, providing single sign on capability  		to SSH sessions. These methods are usually implemented by  		commercial SSH implementations for use in organizations, though  		OpenSSH does have a working GSSAPI implementation.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The connection layer  	(RFC 4254). This layer defines the concept of channels, channel  	requests and global requests using which SSH services are provided.  	A single SSH connection can host multiple channels simultaneously,  	each transferring data in both directions. Channel requests are used  	to relay out-of-band channel specific data, such as the changed size  	of a terminal window or the exit code of a server-side process. The  	SSH client requests a server-side port to be forwarded using a  	global request. Standard channel types include:
        <p> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>shell for terminal shells, SFTP and exec requests (including SCP transfers)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>direct-tcpip for  		client-to-server forwarded connections</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>forwarded-tcpip for  		server-to-client forwarded connections</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The SSHFP DNS record  	(RFC 4255) provides the public host key fingerprints in order to aid  	in verifying the authenticity of the host.
        <p> </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="indent">This open architecture provides  considerable flexibility, allowing SSH to be used for a variety of  purposes beyond secure shell. The functionality of the transport  layer alone is comparable to Transport Layer Security (TLS);  the user authentication layer is highly extensible with custom  authentication methods; and the connection layer provides the ability  to multiplex many secondary sessions into a single SSH connection, a  feature comparable to BEEP and not available in TLS.</p>
