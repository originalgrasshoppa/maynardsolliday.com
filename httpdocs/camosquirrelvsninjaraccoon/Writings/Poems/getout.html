Get out of my mind<br />
Love and obsession are what I feel for you,<br />
Though you cannot or will not love in turn.<br />
Despite what my head tells me is right,<br />
I harbor feelings and a place close to my heart,<br />
Despite the obviousness that I am not what you seek.<br />
I am a fool and afraid to share my feelings with you.<br />
I cry inside when I think of you,<br />
Every time I hear a song or word,<br />
That makes me remember you.<br />
I cry in sorrow as I know we are not meant to be.<br />
I cry in the knowledge that I can not see you.<br />
I cry knowing you do not cryin turn.<br />
Life is colorful when in your presence,<br />
But dull without your company.<br />
<big>REMOVE YOURSELF FROM MY MIND!</big><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
