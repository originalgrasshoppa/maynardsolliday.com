Help me!<br />
I'm going crazy<br />
He won't go away<br />
I threaten, I beg, I pray<br />
I cry, but he just won't go<br />
I used to have him caged<br />
But now he is free within me<br />
He hides in my memories<br />
Trying to make me say and do things<br />
Things I don't wish to do or say<br />
The thoughts he puts in my head<br />
They are beyond indecent<br />
If anyone could read my mind<br />
They would go insane,<br />
From the thoughts<br />
The images<br />
Maybe I am crazy already<br />
Maybe<br />
I can't make him stop<br />
It's like a nightmare<br />
One I cannot awake from<br />
He will destroy me if I cannot stop him<br />
No one can ever know<br />
Help me!</b>
