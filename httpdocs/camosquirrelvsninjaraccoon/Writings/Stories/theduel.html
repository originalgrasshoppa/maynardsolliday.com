<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an unusually hot summer day.  The air sizzled with heat.  The ground singed all that touched it.  The grass burned as the sun had already evaporated the water from its cells.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heat kept all creatures quiet, and yet there was a sound.  It was a sharp sound.  It varied in pitch and duration.

There, again the sound pierced the heated silence.  Suddenly a new sound reverberated through the meadow.  It was the sound of two men yelling.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They yelled once more as their blades danced and beat at eachother, creating the music of a battlefield.

   On towards dusk the men danced to the music of their blades.  Sweat ran down their bodies in streams and their muscles bulged and ached from the strain of fighting on.

     Neither man could back down as it would mean a sure death by the other's blade.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the chill of the night, they continued their deadly dance.  Nocturnal creatures moved slowly away, searching for a quieter place to eat any prey they may catch.  As dawn drew nigh their movement had slowed extensively.  Their form lost it's rigidity and their swings became softer.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their blades clashed and they grunted as they strained to push the other's blade back.  They broke back, and panting, they watched the other in case he began to move.

Their eyes of blue steel and fiery hazel met and they readied themselves, for they could tell that neither would relent their cause.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They each took one last breath and charged at the other.  As their yells clashed, so did their swords.

As they began to struggle to raise their swords, one man thrusted his at the other's chest.The blade was paried and just as he readied to thrust his own blade, an arrow suddenly appeared.  The shaft and white feathered tail jutting out from his neck. As he fell to his knees, he watched as the other man turned to run, yet fell face down on the ground.  Another white feathered arrow was protruding from his back.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkness slowly took the man's vision.  As his life slipped away like a warm breeze in fall, a man dressed in white garb entered his dimming vision.  The man carried a white bow with the fletchings of spare arrows next to his waist, and protruding over his right shoulder was the hilt of a white sword.
