   				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Maynard Solliday.  I go by Mick.  I frequently find myself telling people, technology is not my job or a hobby, it's a lifestyle.  I wake up and begin my day with technology.</p>

    			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I work on computers, virus removal, hardware replacement, software troubleshooting,  helping others with their technology questions and problems.  Everything from Windows to UNIX/Linux, servers, programming languages like SQL, PHP, and JavaScript have been in front of me.  I have a vast amount of experience with a large variety of technology; since 2001.</p>

   				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in networking and telecommunication with an emphasis in web development, after already achieving my associates in web development.</p>

    			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a few hobbies, which I find I have less time for as years go by.  The most notable of these would be gaming, reading, and working out.  Some games I enjoy are Metroid, Demon's Souls, Left 4 Dead, and Resident Evil.  Honestly I like a very wide range of games, but these are the ones that come to the top of my mind.</p>

   				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Books would be another very large list but I have centered on a few specific authors in the last five years including Stephen King, Piers Anthony, and Robert Jordan.</p>

    			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working out, or any other hobbies I have for that matter, is something I have been trying to force back into my busy, weekly schedule.  I tend to lean towards bulk muscle style workouts, maybe it can be attributed to the fact I am a smaller person and feel subconsciously I need to be stronger to keep myself on equal ground, but my opinion is it just fits my personality better.</p>

   				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My family lives in a tiny town in Kansas, I believe the population was about 129 people last time they did a census.  I enjoy going home for visits, where my parents have a tropical themed back yard.  It is a good get-away from work and school.  My father is recently retired and my mother works for The Farm Inc.  which helps children find foster homes and caring families.  My brother is currently working towards a transfer degree from Butler Community College in El Dorado.  He is really interested in the personal fitness/physical therapy field and plans to go on to KU for his bachelor's.</p>
