<div id="heading">Name :</div><p class="indent">Mick Solliday</p>

<div id="heading">Where I live :</div><p class="indent">I live near El Dorado.</p>

<div id="heading">Job :</div><p class="indent">I work as a Tec-e for the I.S. Dept. at Butler Community College.

</p>

<div id="heading">My Hobbies :</div><p class="indent">I play video games, mess with computers, and watch anime.  I enjoy reading but do it less than the others.</p>

<div id="heading">Personality :</div><p class="indent">I believe myself to be laid-back, I enjoy jokes and find humor in many situations.  
The only bad part of my personality is that I am stubborn.  In example, if I truly believe something needs to go a certain way, it is hard to change my opinion, without good reasoning.</p>

<div id="heading">Traits :</div><p class="indent">Hard working, laid-back, calm, mildly impulsive, devoted, and honorable.</p>

<div id="heading">Peeves :</div><p class="indent">Mostly liars and people who can't keep their word.</p>

<div id="heading">Things I like to do :</div><p class="indent">I enjoy star-gazing, eating, camping, fishing, soccer, spending time with friends.</p>

<div id="heading">Things I like to do with others :</div><p class="indent">Helping others with problems, about anything that I can do with others, I enjoy.</p>

<div id="heading">Things about my future:</div><p class="indent">I plan to graduate from Butler Community College this fall with my Web Developement degree, and take some transfer credits for Fort Hays.  I plan to get a major in Network Administration, but they also have a 4-year web degree so it's possible.</p>

<div id="heading">Sexual Orientation :</div><p class="indent">Straight.</p>

<div id="heading">Life perspective:</div><p class="upper">If you aren't living for happiness and to make others happy, you aren't living.  If people ask you to go somewhere, and there is no reason not to go, you ought to go.  Just get out meet people, invest time in friends and relationships(not just sexual ones) and pursue a life of happiness with others.  One day, when you are alone and have no one left beside you and you may just need someone to talk to, no one will be there becuase you were to wrapped up in yourself and your own crap to realize that maybe these people who want to be around you are your friends and want to help you and be there for you, but you let them slip away.  Life is short, friendships can be eternal, but you gotta pursue them.
</p>
<p class="middle">All relationships, whether it be boyfriend, girlfriend, neighbor, classmate, friends, or even family take some work to maintain, but if you let them go and don't work to try to keep the relationship, it will fade and so will your friends, until you are alone.  So live your P.O.S. life and don't live on your computer.  Get out, visit people, partake in events outside of school and work.
Live a satisfied and wholesome life.
</p>
<p class="bottom">
I was once told by a great woman that life is about experiences.  If you don't live life and experience things, you might as well be dead.  She struck it on the nose, I think.  If you don't experience things, why do you live anyways?  Experiences are what make us who we are, they make us into people, they give us personality and character and wisdom.
Just experience life, that's what it's all about.
</p>

<div id="heading">Self Overview:</div><p class="indent">
I am a fairly self confident person, there is not a whole lot that I feel I can&acute;t accomplish if I want to.
I hope to someday make mucho bucks messing with computers or electronic hardware. That's why I go to college, right?
As for current goals, I hope to save back enough money to cover an upgrade for my computer, and possibly afford a girlfriend...</p>

<div id="heading">Worst Fear(s):</div><p class="indent">Being alone is a big one.  Not physically, but emotionally and mentally.  I want to have someone I can talk to, no matter what.  Someone who just listens, then tells me their view and tries to help out.  I am terrified of being alone.  It does extend somewhat to the physical side but it's not really contact so much as someone there to share my experiences, someone who will share theirs with me.  Not just the good but the bad too.  I want to help them in their times of need as well as them in mine.
</p>

<div id="heading">Past experiences:</div><p class="indent">The one that will probably stick with me the rest of my life is when I was in 1st or 2nd grade.  I lived on a farm at the time and we raised ducks, geese, chickens, a couple turkeys, pigs, some guinea fowl , and a couple cattle.  This actually involves the ducks.  We were running them out of their pen because they had been kept up in a chicken coop for winter.  Well I was sent in and was chasing them out when I tripped on something and fell face down on the ground.  The only thing between me and smacking my face on the ground was a single weed stalk.  Of course, it couldn't have hit my cheek or shoulder or something, it went right up my left nostril.  It punctured a lymph-node in my nose and blood just started pouring out of my nose.  And yes, OF COURSE IT HURT.  I was in pain for a while after that.  I made it to the doctor and he said all will be well just take it easy on blowing the nose for a week or two.  Talk about an experience.
