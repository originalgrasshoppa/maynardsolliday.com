<p>With all the thoughts of boredom, you sit on the plane hoping for something 
interesting to happen.</p>
<p>As the plan flies along, a siren begins to sound only one hour into the 
flight.</p>
<p>Startled, you fall off your chair. Getting up you run towards the cockpit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you approach, the plane erupts in violent tremors,</p>
<p>and the sound of an explosion reaches you from the other side of the door to 
the cockpit.</p>
<p>You are blown back by the force, and hit the crate.&nbsp; You try to get up 
but feel the plain falling, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so decide it would be better to hang on to the crate for safety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Jesus,&quot; you think, then an enormous crunch with immense force pulling 
you down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You smack against the cockpit door and every thing goes dark.</p>
