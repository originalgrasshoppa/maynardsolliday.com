<p><b>You decided against running, not my recommended course of action.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Well, You pull out your knife and gun.&nbsp; As you attack with the knife 
one of the squirrels cuts your blade in half.&nbsp; </b></p>
<p><b>That means you have one choice left, quickly you jump back then aiming you 
shoot your gun.&nbsp; the first shot catches the one with the purple rod off 
guard. He drops, but the next shot--</b></p>
<p><b>You didn't even see where the next one went, but I will explain what 
happened.</b></p>
<p><b>You took the shot but the next squirrel saw it coming, it used it's &quot;rod&quot; 
to reflect the bullet.&nbsp; It just so happened the reflected bullet smacked 
you in the face.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>In case you don't know, that means you are dead.</b></p>
